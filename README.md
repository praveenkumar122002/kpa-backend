Sample Request/Response: Matches the assignmentâ€™s provided structure.

How to Test
Import the included Postman collection (KPA_form data.postman_collection.json) into Postman.

Use the sample data above to make POST and GET requests.

(Optional) Run the provided frontend and verify it communicates with your backend.

Assumptions & Limitations
No authentication is implemented for simplicity.

Fields with dynamic or variable content are stored as JSON in the database.

API responses strictly follow the structures given in the assignment and sample Postman docs.

Additional Info / Bonus Features
Docker support included for quick local setup (see Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml).

Basic input validation is handled by DRF serializers.

Uses environment-based configuration for sensitive settings via .env.
